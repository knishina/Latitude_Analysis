### Summary.
This folder, ```Latitude_Analysis```, is my first attempt at front-end development.  It is a web page that uses CSS and Bootstrap to [display data](https://github.com/knishina/uc_berkeley_bootcamp/tree/master/HW06_APIs); the data were obtained from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api), analyzed using Pandas, and visualized using Matplotlib.

<br />

### Features.
There is a navigation tab at the top, right corner.  Each of the options will be covered below.

#### Plots.
The button labeled `Plots` is a drop-down menu with four options.  It directs the page to the corresponding graph and written analysis of the data.

#### Comparison.
The button labeled `Comparison` directs the page to a carousel of the graphs.  Selecting the graph will direct the page to the corresponding graph and written analysis of the data.  The final option on the carousel has four graphs.  By selecting the four graph option, it stops the carousel and directs the page to the image.

#### Visualizations.
The section labeled `Visualizations` has the four graphs displayed.  Upon hovering over the graph, a green label will appear with the corresponding plot label as seen in the `Plots` drop-down menu.  Each of the graphs can be selected and serves as another navigation tool to get to the analysis.
